## Android Debloat Script (Soft Purge)
### Script to de-bloat Android devices, while keeping some practical functionality.

This script is intended to remove excessive and invasive software from Android devices, while keeping Quality-of-Life software and stability. I will explain my reasoning as to what software is kept or removed, according to my research.

Before we start, I would like to state that this script is intended to be used on devices that have **close-to-stock ROMs**, such as Pixel or Motorola devices. This script **was** tested on a **Motorola** device. Why Motorola, you ask? While a Pixel device would be ideal for debloating **and** installing custom ROMs, Pixels are not readly available on markets outside of the US. As such, I am making this script thinking of brands that are easily found on most countries.

The brands that were considered for this script were: ASUS; Huawei; LG; Motorola; Samsung; Sony; Xiaomi. Out of all of these, Motorola offers a ROM that is closest to stock and affordable phones with not much bloat shipped by default. Because of that, this script is also compatible with Pixel devices.
